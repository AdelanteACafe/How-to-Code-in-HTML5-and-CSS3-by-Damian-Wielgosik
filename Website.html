		<h1>Bagel the Cat: since i learned to code mi vida ha mejorado</h1>
		<p>Posted by: Bagel J Cat  :)</p>
	</header>
	<p>Yowling nonstop the whole night stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep but eat the rubberband. I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! flop over, for kitty power or chase after silly colored fish toys around the house yet where is my slave? I'm getting hungry for eat the rubberband so you have cat to be kitten me right meow. </p>

		<p>Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard but jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed.
			<q>  Please stop looking at your phone and pet me. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out, attack feet. I am the best peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face for twitch tail in permanent irritation eat grass, throw it back up cat fur is the new black.</q> -Thought for the Day.  :)

(both the final "div" in the HTML fileand final piece of code in the CSS file), the CSS command to float left (goal is to put them in a straight line instead of vertical like they are 
now) isn't working, just cant figure out why. As of Sept 18 2018 I will let this rest for now and return to Freecodecamp work  -->
